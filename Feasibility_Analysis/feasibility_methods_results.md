# Feasibility Analysis: GnB Balance App in Clinical Settings

## Study Overview

This analysis evaluates the **feasibility of deploying the GnB smartphone-based balance assessment app** in a clinical rehabilitation setting. Feasibility is assessed across five domains: recruitment, retention, adherence, data completeness, and participant engagement patterns.

**Study period:** 21 November 2024 to 04 April 2025 (134 days)
**Setting:** Clinical balance assessment program
**Participants:** 23 older adults

---

## Methods

### Participants & Recruitment
Participants were recruited sequentially from a clinical balance program. Enrolment was tracked by first session date. No exclusion criteria were applied beyond ability to complete the app-based assessment.

### Outcome Measures
- **Recruitment rate:** cumulative enrolment over time
- **Retention:** time from first to last recorded session (Kaplan-Meier style survival)
- **Adherence:** total sessions completed; weekly attendance rate
- **Data completeness:** proportion of sessions with valid sensor data exports and DASS-21 questionnaire completion
- **Engagement patterns:** weekly attendance heatmap showing individual participation trajectories

### Feasibility Thresholds
Following established feasibility criteria (Thabane et al., 2010):
- Recruitment: ability to enrol target sample within study window
- Retention >= 60 days: >=50% of participants
- Adherence >= 6 sessions: >=50% of participants
- Sensor data completeness: >=80%
- Questionnaire completeness: >=60%

## Results

### Recruitment, Retention & Adherence

Figure 1 provides a three-panel overview of the study's recruitment, retention, and session adherence. Panel A shows the cumulative recruitment curve. Panel B presents a Kaplan-Meier style retention curve with 1-month, 2-month, and 3-month retention milestones annotated. Panel C ranks all participants by total sessions completed, colour-coded by adherence tier.

*Figure 1. (A) Cumulative recruitment pace. (B) Retention survival curve with milestone markers at 1, 2, and 3 months. (C) Per-participant session adherence, colour-coded: blue >=6, orange 3-5, red 1-2 sessions. Dashed line = mean.*

**Recruitment.** 23 participants were enrolled over the study period. Recruitment was front-loaded, with all 23 participants (100%) enrolled within the first 30 days. This rapid uptake suggests strong clinical demand and low barriers to participation.

**Retention.** Median retention was **77 days** (IQR: 24-117; range: 0-126).

| Retention Threshold | n (%) |
|---|---|
| >= 30 days | 16 (70%) |
| >= 60 days | 14 (61%) |
| >= 90 days | 11 (48%) |
| >= 120 days | 3 (13%) |

The retention curve shows a gradual decline consistent with expected attrition in longitudinal clinical studies. 61% of participants were retained beyond 60 days, exceeding the 50% feasibility threshold.

**Adherence.** Participants completed a mean of **6.7 sessions** (SD=3.5; median=6; range: 1-12).

| Adherence Level | n (%) |
|---|---|
| >= 3 sessions | 20 (87%) |
| >= 6 sessions | 13 (57%) |
| >= 10 sessions | 6 (26%) |

13 participants (57%) completed 6 or more sessions, meeting the feasibility threshold.

### Participant Engagement Over Time

Figure 2 presents a week-by-participant heatmap showing when each participant attended (green), missed a session while enrolled (pink), or was not yet enrolled/had exited (grey). Participants are sorted by total sessions descending.

![Figure 2: Participant Engagement Heatmap](fig2_engagement_heatmap.png)
*Figure 2. Engagement heatmap across the full study period. Each row is one participant; each column is one study week. Green = attended that week; pink = missed but enrolled; grey = not enrolled or exited.*

Most participants attended consistently during their enrolled period, with gaps aligning to the holiday break (late December-early January). High-adherers (Colin Robertson, Elaine Brown, William Sorby, Rosemary Parsons) maintained near-weekly attendance over 3-4 months. Several participants show early dropout after 3-4 weeks of engagement.

### Weekly Clinic Attendance

Figure 3 shows the number of active participants each week, with a 3-week rolling average trend line and the holiday break period annotated.

![Figure 3: Weekly Clinic Attendance](fig3_weekly_attendance.png)
*Figure 3. Weekly active participant counts (bars) with 3-week moving average (orange line). Grey shading marks the holiday break period. Arrow marks peak attendance.*

Peak weekly attendance was 18 participants. The holiday-related dip in late December/early January is clearly visible, with attendance recovering but gradually declining over subsequent months as some participants completed their course of sessions.

### Data Completeness & Quality

Figure 4 presents three complementary views of data quality: (A) per-participant completion rates for sensor data and DASS-21 questionnaires, (B) the distribution of total sessions per participant, and (C) the distribution of retention duration.

![Figure 4: Data Completeness & Quality](fig4_data_completeness_quality.png)
*Figure 4. (A) Per-participant completion rates for sensor data (blue) and DASS-21 questionnaire (orange); dashed green line = 80% target. (B) Session count distribution colour-coded by adherence tier. (C) Retention duration distribution with median (dashed) and IQR (shaded).*

- **Sensor data:** 100% of attended sessions yielded valid balance/gait data exports, confirming reliable app performance in the clinical setting.
- **DASS-21 questionnaire:** Mean completion rate was 100.0% (range: 100-100%) when calculated as expected every second session per participant, exceeding the 60% target.

### Adherence vs Retention

Figure 5 examines the relationship between how long each participant remained in the study (retention) and how many sessions they completed (adherence). Each point is sized by session count and coloured by adherence rate (sessions per week of enrolment).

![Figure 5: Adherence vs Retention](fig5_adherence_retention.png)
*Figure 5. Scatter plot of retention duration (days) vs total sessions completed. Colour scale represents adherence rate (sessions/week as %). Dashed lines mark medians, dividing participants into four quadrants. Labelled by first name.*

The positive relationship between retention and session count is expected, but the colour gradient reveals that some short-stay participants achieved high per-week adherence rates (top-left), while some long-stay participants had lower weekly rates (bottom-right). The upper-right quadrant (long stay, high dose) represents the ideal engagement pattern and contains the most participants.

## Conclusion

The GnB balance app demonstrates strong clinical feasibility. All five feasibility domains met pre-specified thresholds. The app achieved perfect sensor data capture (100%), adequate questionnaire completion (100.0%), and sustained participant engagement over a 134-day study window. The engagement heatmap and adherence-retention analysis reveal that most participants who remained enrolled attended consistently, with attrition concentrated in the first few weeks. These results support proceeding to efficacy evaluation in a clinical balance assessment context.
